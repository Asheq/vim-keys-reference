{char}
        usually represents any printable character (including <Tab> but not <BS>) but sometimes {char} is used lazily (e.g. CTRL-W {char})

{motion}
        always represents a motion; always follows an operator

{a-zA-Z0-9.%#:-"}
{a-zA-Z0-9}
{A-Za-z}
{0-9a-zA-Z"}
{a-z}
        always represents those characters exactly

{count}
        irrelevant because it is a prefix

{filter}
{pattern}
        irrelevant because they invoke a prompt where you can type anything
